#### Website: <https://dic-pig-game.netlify.app>

#### Description:

This program represents a dice game in which two players compete against each other. At the beginning of the game both players have a score of 0 and one active player is chosen. The active player can then click the "Roll Dice" button to get a random number and add that number to their score. However, if the roll is a 1, the active player loses all points for that round and the next player becomes active. The active player can also click the "Hold" button to save their points for that round and hand them over to the other player. The game ends when one player reaches 100 points and that player is declared the winner.
